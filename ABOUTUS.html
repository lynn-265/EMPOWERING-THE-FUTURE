      <h2>We Are the Echo</h2>
      <p>We are the echo of every silenced voice. The ripple of every untold story. We are EqualFuture—and we exist to make gender equality not just a dream, but a reality.</p>

      <h2>Where We Began</h2>
      <p>Our journey started in a classroom where girls were told to be quiet, and boys were told to lead. It grew in boardrooms, in refugee camps, in homes where expectations were unequal. We saw the patterns—and we chose to break them.</p>

    <section class="section3">
      <h2>What We Believe</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Equality is not optional:</strong> It’s a human right.</li>
        <li><strong>Stories change systems:</strong> We center lived experiences to drive reform.</li>
        <li><strong>Hope is a strategy:</strong> We act with urgency, but never without optimism.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section4">
      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <p>We host forums where silence becomes speech. We partner with schools, governments, and communities to rewrite the rules. Our work is local, global, and deeply personal.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section5">
      <h2>This Is Your Fight Too</h2>
      <p>Gender inequality doesn’t just hurt women, it limits everyone. If you’ve ever felt boxed in by expectations, overlooked because of identity, or outraged by injustice—this is your movement!</p>
