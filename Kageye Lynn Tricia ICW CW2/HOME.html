        <p>Gender inequality affects every corner of society—from education and employment to health and leadership. It's time to challenge the norms and create a world where everyone has equal opportunity, regardless of gender.</p>

      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Education:</strong> Millions of girls worldwide are denied access to basic education.</li>
        <li><strong>Workplace:</strong> Women earn less than men for the same work in nearly every country.</li>
        <li><strong>Leadership:</strong> Women hold fewer than 30% of leadership roles globally.</li>
        <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Gender-based violence remains a widespread human rights issue. <br> Men can not report cases of assault due to fear of being laughed at.</li>
      </ul>
